# Image-Restoration-using-Vision-Transformers-
Sand image restoration is vital for autonomous vehicles and satellite imaging. Traditional CNN and GAN methods struggle with global context. This work builds a Pix2Pix GAN baseline and proposes using Vision Transformers to improve restoration. A synthetic sand-affected dataset is created, and ViT performance will be compared with the baseline.
